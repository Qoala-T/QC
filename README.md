## Qoala-T: A supervised-learning tool to assess accuracy of manual quality control of automated neuroanatomical labeling in developmental MRI data

Version 1 14 feb 2018
Qoala-T is developed in the [Brain and development research center](https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl) by [Lara Wierenga](https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl/index.php/people/post-docs/181-post-doctoral-researchers/273-lara-wierenga) and [Eduard Klapwijk](https://www.brainanddevelopmentlab.nl/index.php/people/post-docs/181-post-doctoral-researchers/287-eduard-klapwijk)

About
-----
Qoala-T is a supervised learning tool that asseses accuracy of manual control of automated neuroanatomical labeling of FreeSurfer processed T1 imaging scans. It is particularly suitable for developmental datasets. 
This reproducibility package contains data and R code for the steps 2B and 4 as part of our Qoala-T tool descirbed in Klapwijk et al ., (in prep).  

### Running Qoala-T
To be able to run Qoala-T, your T1 MRI images should be processed in [FreeSurfer V6.0](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall). Next run [stats2table_bash_qoala_t.sh]<https://github.com/larawierenga/Qoala-T-under-construction/blob/master/stats2table_bash_qoala_t.sh> to create an input file for the Qoala-T tool.
